    Write a python script to recurse a given directory location and return a list of files whose names match a regex
    (or maybe just whose size is > than some number)
        - filescanner.py
    Write unit tests for the above.  Demonstrate your code coverage and justify it (i.e. why is this good enough)
        - python -m unittest test_filescanner.py
        - coverage run --source unittest test_filescanner.py
            coverage report -m
    Demonstrate execution time.  How might this be improved
        -
        - spliting operations over threads.
         using ready-built modules (os.walk).
          interacting with os filesystem directly (more error prone)
