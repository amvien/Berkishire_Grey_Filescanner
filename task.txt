    Write a python script to recurse a given directory location and return a list of files whose names match a regex
    (or maybe just whose size is > than some number)
    Write unit tests for the above.  Demonstrate your code coverage and justify it (i.e. why is this good enough)
    Demonstrate execution time.  How might this be improved
